Project: Predator-prey Simulation
Authors: Saif Latifi, Jad Sbai, David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

The simulation that we decided to implement was a jungle environment. As in the original simulation, there are 2 categories of animals – predators and prey. The prey we simulated in this project were:
• Elephants
• Monkeys
We also simulated 3 predators:
• Tigers (eat Monkeys, Elephants and Jaguars)
• Jaguars (eat Monkeys and Cobras)
• Cobras (eat Monkeys)

Implemented tasks: - All base tasks (mandatory) - Simulating Plants (suggested) - Simulating Weather (suggested) - Simulating Disease (suggested) - Simulating Poisonous Plants (our own)

To start this application, run the Main method inside the Simulator class.

The overall outcome of the simulation can be changed by modifying different parameters such as: - breeding/spread probability - food value - predators' food sources - maximum age - maximum number of offsprings - creation probability

This project can be extended by : - adding more preys and predators - simulating different types of diseases - simulating different types of plants
